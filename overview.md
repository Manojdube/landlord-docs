# 📅 Project Overview

The Landlord App is a mobile-first, open-source platform that allows landlords to manage tenants, dues, payments, and expenses.

### 📊 Why This Exists
- Manual tracking is hard for small landlords
- Rent payment cycles are repetitive and error-prone
- Tenants lack visibility in dues and history

### 🔍 Target Audience
- Small-scale landlords
- Tenants in low-to-middle income housing
- NGOs or agencies working in housing access

### 🚀 Vision
- Empower both landlords and tenants
- Bring transparency to rent and expense flows
- Build a community-driven tool for housing management
